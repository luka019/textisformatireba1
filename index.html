<br>
<strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry.
<i><p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p></i>
<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br>Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <strong><s>Aldus PageMaker</s></strong> including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
